Editing the _list:

patches on subsequent lines are squashed. put an empty line between each
patch or group of patches that should become a new commit.

Within each group, a * at beginning of line indicates the patch that
determines the message and author time of the new commit.
Alternatively, a group can be followed by the commit message in square
brackets:
[
commit message

multi line possible
]

(Or even more alternatively, add a line \d+ message file hm? untested
or even unfinished)

Except within [ commit messages ], # can be used for comment lines.
