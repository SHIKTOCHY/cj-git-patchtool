- reuse original author as well, not only time, if it's the same for all patches. right?

- handle CR vs CRLF etc gracefully somehow (repo with CRLF or something gives patches that don't apply)

- wig should not remove newly created files out of a patchfile
  (i.e. a patch creates new files, and has some conflict in a change
  to an existing file; wig will update the change to an existing file,
  but ditch the newly created files. fix that.)

[- would it be possible to handle merge commits usefully? i.e. reuse
  conflict merges that might already have been solved there.]
